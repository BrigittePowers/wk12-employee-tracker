# TownPortal - Employee Tracker
  
  ## Description
  *What is it and why was it made?*

  TownPortal is a program through node that allows communication to a MySQL database. TP allows the creation of departments and job positions within those departments; it then allows one to add employee information and lookup database-stored info whenever needed. 

  The ultimate goal of TownPortal is to allow one to keep track of their company employee data in a way that is succinct, comprehensible, and efficient. Ideally, it is a program that allows an employer to manage their company with reduced setbacks.
